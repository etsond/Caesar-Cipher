# Caesar Cipher 
### FEATURES
This repository contains a C program that implements the Caesar cipher for shifting the text by a given number of positions. The program takes a string and a shift value as input from the user, and outputs the shifted text.

### Installation
To run this program, you will need a C compiler installed on your computer. If you don't have a C compiler installed, you can download and install one from the following links:

-  [GCC for Windows](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html)
- [GCC for Mac](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/InstallingGCC)
- [GCC for Linux](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can download or clone this repository using the following command:

```ruby
git clone https://github.com/etsond/shifting_of_text.git
```
## Usage

To use this program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded or cloned this repository. Then navigate to the caesar directory and run the following command:
```ruby
gcc caesar.c -o caesar
```
This will compile the program and create an executable file called caesar. To run the program, enter the following command:
```ruby
./caesar
```
The program will prompt you to enter a string and a shift value. Enter the string and shift value as requested, and the program will output the shifted text.
